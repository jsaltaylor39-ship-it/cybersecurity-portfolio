## 3. Findings
- Identified overly permissive IAM policies on some users  
- Applied least privilege policies to restrict access to critical resources  
- CloudTrail successfully logged all unauthorized access attempts  
- EC2 instances enforced proper IAM role permissions

- Monitoring via CloudTrail is essential for incident detection  
- Regular policy reviews help maintain a strong security posture  
- Hands-on lab reinforced the importance of secure configuration in enterprise cloud environments
