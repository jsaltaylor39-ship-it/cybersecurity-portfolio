#  Cloud Security Lab Report â€“ AWS IAM Lab

**Platform:** **AWS**  
**Lab:** **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Lab**  
**Date:** **08/21/2025**  
**Analyst:** **Jessica Taylor**

## 1. Objectives
- **Configure IAM users, groups, and policies**  
- **Enable CloudTrail monitoring and logging**  
- **Test least privilege access**  

---

## 2. Setup
- **Services used:** EC2, S3, IAM, CloudTrail  
- **Network/Architecture:**  
  - Single VPC with public and private subnets  
  - EC2 instance for testing access controls  
  - IAM roles assigned to groups  
- **Architecture Diagram:** ![Architecture Diagram](../docs/aws-iam-architecture.png)  

---

## 3. Findings
- **Misconfigurations identified:** overly permissive IAM policies  
- **Security controls applied:** least privilege policies, role-based access  
- **Test results:** CloudTrail successfully logged unauthorized access attempts; EC2 instances enforced proper IAM role permissions  

---

## 4. Lessons Learned
- **Least privilege reduces risk** of accidental or malicious access  
- **Monitoring via CloudTrail** is essential for incident detection  
- **Regular policy reviews** maintain strong security posture  
- **Hands-on lab experience** reinforces secure cloud configuration best practices
