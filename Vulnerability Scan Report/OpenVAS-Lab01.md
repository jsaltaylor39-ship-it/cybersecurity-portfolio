## 3. Findings

| Vulnerability                     | CVSS Score | Affected Host    | Impact                                | Remediation                       |
|----------------------------------|------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| SSL Certificate Expired           | 6.5 (Medium)| 192.168.20.12  | Data in transit may be intercepted   | Renew SSL certificates           |
| Outdated Apache Version           | 7.8 (High)  | 192.168.20.15  | Remote code execution possible       | Update Apache to latest version  |
| Missing Security Updates (Linux)  | 6.3 (Medium)| 192.168.20.18  | Privilege escalation risk             | Apply all critical security updates|
| Weak SSH Cipher Configuration     | 5.5 (Medium)| 192.168.20.22  | Potential eavesdropping or MITM      | Disable weak ciphers, enforce strong SSH protocols |
