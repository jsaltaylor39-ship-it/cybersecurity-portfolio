## 3. Findings

| Vulnerability                     | CVSS Score | Source Scanner | Affected Host    | Impact                                | Remediation                       |
|----------------------------------|------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| SMB Signing Not Required           | 5.3 (Medium)| Nessus         | 192.168.10.12  | Allows Man-in-the-Middle attacks     | Enable SMB signing               |
| Outdated OpenSSH Version           | 7.5 (High)  | Nessus         | 192.168.10.15  | Remote code execution possible       | Update OpenSSH to latest version |
| SSL Certificate Expired            | 6.5 (Medium)| OpenVAS        | 192.168.20.12  | Data in transit may be intercepted   | Renew SSL certificates           |
| Weak SSH Cipher Configuration      | 5.5 (Medium)| OpenVAS        | 192.168.20.22  | Potential eavesdropping or MITM      | Disable weak ciphers, enforce strong SSH protocols |
| Missing Windows Patches            | 6.8 (Medium)| THM Lab        | 192.168.10.20  | Privilege escalation risk            | Apply critical security updates  |
| Weak Password Policy Detected      | 6.0 (Medium)| THM Lab        | 192.168.10.25  | Increased chance of credential compromise | Enforce strong password policy |

## 4. Summary & Recommendations
- **High-severity issues** should be addressed immediately (e.g., Outdated OpenSSH, Apache versions)  
- **Medium-severity findings** can be mitigated through configuration hardening and patch management  
- **Credentialed scans** provided deeper insight than unauthenticated scans  
- **Documentation of findings** ensures repeatable SOC procedures and professional portfolio presentation  

---

## 5. Lessons Learned
- **Consistent patching and updates** are essential for security  
- **Configuration management** reduces exposure to common vulnerabilities  
- **Logging and monitoring** help detect and prevent exploitation attempts  
- **Consolidated reports** provide a holistic view of network security posture for lab and enterprise environments
