## 1. Objectives
- **Analyze malware samples** in a controlled environment  
- **Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)**  
- **Determine malware behavior, impact, and remediation strategies**  

---

## 2. Setup
- **Services used:** Virtual lab VMs, Wireshark, Process Explorer, Sysinternals Suite  
- **Network/Architecture:**  
  - Isolated lab VM with snapshot restore capabilities  
  - Monitoring VM running Wireshark for network traffic capture  
  - Logging enabled to capture system changes and file modifications  
- **Diagram:**

## 3. Findings
- **Malware type identified:** Trojan with keylogging and persistence mechanisms  
- **System impact:** Created hidden autorun entries, modified registry keys, and attempted network beaconing  
- **Network traffic:** Outbound connections to suspicious IP addresses were observed and captured in Wireshark  
- **Mitigation steps applied:** Lab VM reverted to snapshot, malware quarantined, IOC list documented  
- **Potential enterprise risk:** Unchecked malware could exfiltrate sensitive data and compromise system integrity

## 4. Lessons Learned
- **Controlled lab environment** is essential for safe malware analysis  
- **Monitoring system changes and network traffic** helps identify malicious behavior  
- **Documentation of IOCs** allows faster response and prevention in real networks  
- **Hands-on analysis reinforces understanding** of malware tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) use
